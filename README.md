## W-Shop 
<br />
By Team Enigmatic 

# Idea:

Female consumers is India have been long ignored. Our findings suggest that companies would benefit by paying attention to India’s female rural consumers’ hopes and dreams and crafting the right strategies for fulfilling them. <br />
To devise offerings and marketing campaigns that will appeal to these consumers, companies need to understand—and then let go of—all-too-common myths about female consumers in India’s hinterlands. <br />
According to a survey, 20% of rural women buy some of their products online. But there is no infrastructure in place to meet these women's requirements so that they have a comfortable experience of shopping while also gaining value for money they put in. <br />
<br /> <br />
Our solution is a two-part one: <br />
1.Offering essential and everyday goods at an attractive discounted price. <br />
2.Empowering women with curated content on Financial Literacy. <br />
<br /> <br />
